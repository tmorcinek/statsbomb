# ⚽ AI-based Player Evaluation using StatsBomb Data

This repository contains all the code and data processing steps used in my master's thesis project:  
**“Application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Analysis of Football Actions: A Player Evaluation Model for Scouting Purposes.”**

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning-based player evaluation model that assists in the football scouting process.  
The model aims to provide an **initial, objective rating of outfield players** based on detailed event-level data, helping scouts to identify players worth further observation.

## 📊 Data Source

All data used in this project comes from the open dataset published by [StatsBomb](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data).  
The analysis focuses specifically on the matches from **UEFA EURO 2024**, including both standard event data and available 360° contextual frames.

## 🔍 Key Features


## 🧪 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- `pandas` – data processing  
- `statsbombpy` – modified by me to access local data  
- `mplsoccer`, `matplotlib` – visualizations  
- Machine Learning (to be added in the next phase)

## 🧠 Future Work

- Feature engineering for ML model
- Model training (e.g., classification or regression of player performance)
- Evaluation using post-tournament player reputation or expert data
