# ‚öΩ AI-based Player Evaluation using StatsBomb Data

This repository contains all the code and data processing steps used in my master's thesis project:  
**‚ÄúApplication of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Analysis of Football Actions: A Player Evaluation Model for Scouting Purposes.‚Äù**

## üéØ Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning-based player evaluation model that assists in the football scouting process.  
The model aims to provide an **initial, objective rating of outfield players** based on detailed event-level data, helping scouts to identify players worth further observation.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Source

All data used in this project comes from the open dataset published by [StatsBomb](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data).  
The analysis focuses specifically on the matches from **UEFA EURO 2024**, including both standard event data and available 360¬∞ contextual frames.

## üß† Features

### üìã Lineups

This project includes tools for extracting and displaying **starting lineups** from StatsBomb data in a structured and readable format.

```python
import src.lineups.matches as ln

ln.display_match_lineups(3943043)			# no title
ln.display_match_lineups(3943043, 55, 282)		# with title generated using competition data 
```

The function above retrieves and formats the starting XIs for both teams in a given match ‚Äî in this case, the final of UEFA EURO 2024. It uses lineup data from the statsbombpy library and maps player positions according to StatsBomb‚Äôs taxonomy.

Visual representation of starting lineups for match ID 3943043.

This information is essential for:
- Understanding players‚Äô tactical roles,
- Comparing positional context when evaluating actions and metrics,
- Enhancing the interpretability of player ratings generated by the model.

### Events 

#### List of all possible event types

```python
import src.utils as utl

type_counts = utl.get_events_type_counts(3930167)
